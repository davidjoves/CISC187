# CISC187
**Description:** 
<br>
My programming assignments in C++ that consists of knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Demonstrates linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary tree.
<br>
**Disclaimer:** 
<br>
Whoever it comes across to, if you are enrolled into CISC 187 I really recommend you try to do this on your own. Don't take the easy way. Plus Professor Billie knows my code is on here. If you do end up looking at it, please reference me. Give credit when credit is due.

**File Breakdown:** 
#### Module 1 
- C++ Review, Creation of Looping Menu, File Formatting for Professor Billie
#### Module 2 
- Recreation of Module 1, but using pointers instead of indexing. 
#### Module 3 
- Introducing header files and its format, first OOP assignment in C++, and introduction to user validations
#### Module 4 
- Creation of Linked List, consisting of algorithms to work with a linked list (insert, append, delete, search, and display)
#### Module 5 
- Creation of a Stack, consists of algorithms to work with a stack (push,pop,capitalize, and display)
#### Module 6 
- Creation of a Queue, consists of algorithms  to work with a queue (enqueue, dequeue, serach, and count). '
- Also introduces concept of recursion and how it's implemented into the algorthims. 
#### Module 7
- Creation of a Binary Tree, consists of algorithms to work with a Binary Tree (insert, in order traversal, count leaves, count height, count width)
